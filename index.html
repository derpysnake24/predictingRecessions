        <h2> Introduction: </h2>
		<p>
		    For this project I will be using a deep learning model to predict recessions. 
		    I will begin with a brief overview of the problem and a review of previous 
		    literature, and follow with an overview of the data I will be using. Then 
		    I will go over how the model itself works and the results I got. Overall my 
		    model does a pretty good job at classifying whether a quarter will be a 
		    recession or not. 
		    <br><br>
		    Economists have been trying to accurately predict economic downturns for as long as
			it has been a discipline. With recent developments in machine learning and neural
			networks, it is becoming increasingly more likely that this could become a reality. 
			Even before machine learning took off, economists attempted to predict recessions 
			found some success using a variable know as "term spread". Term spread is the difference 
			between interest rates on long term bonds, typically 10 or 5 year bonds, and short
			term bonds, which fall between 1 year and 3 months. Two highly cited papers, 
			Wheelock and Wohar (2009) and Mehl (2008) provide a good overview of the literature correlating
			term spread to economic output and give an example of a model using standard economic practice
			instead of machine of learning. Both papers are careful to highlight the lack of an agreed-upon
			theory that realtes the two variables, only that the relationship appears to exist. 
			<br><br>
			More recently, papers have been published using machine learning to predict recessions using
			the term spread. Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) introduced the economic community to the 
			possibility of machine learning being used for major problems, with close to 1000 citations 
			and providing major inspiration for this project. Vrontos, Galakis, and Vrontos (2021) looked 
			at term spread a recessions using mulitple different machine learning techniques, inlcuding logit 
			regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors to name a few. This paper 
			provided inspiration for further variables to use in addition to term spread and how to use them.

	<h2> Data:</h2>
	    <p>
		The data I used for this project was taken from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) of St Louis. 
		    All the data is for the United States and is taken at intervals of quarters of a year since 1982-2021.
		    The variables I settled on for my final model were: term spread of 10 year and 3 month treasury bonds, 
		    growth rate of total industry exlcuding construction, the sticky consumer price index (CPI; this is a standard 
		    measure of inflation), private direct investment into residential investments as percent of GDP, the 
		    non-cylcical rate of unemployment (NROU; a standard measure of unemployment that is more stable over time than
		    the unemployment rate), the employment to population ratio, population growth rate, gross national income growth
		    rate, GDP per capita growth rate, GDP growth rate, CPI for energy, CPI for food, standard unemployment rate, 
		    the real M2 money supply, and household liabilities as a percentage of income. The output variable is a binary variable,
		    where 1 represents a quarter where a recessions took place and 0 does not, inferred by the Federal Reserve based 
		    on a GDP recession indicator. The following graphic displays the variables overtime.
