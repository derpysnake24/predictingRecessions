        <h2> Introduction: </h2>
        <p>
            For this project I will be using a deep learning model to predict recessions. 
            I will begin with a brief overview of the problem and a review of previous 
            literature, and follow with an overview of the data I will be using. Then 
            I will go over how the model itself works and the results I got. Overall my 
            model does a pretty good job at classifying whether a quarter  will be a 
            recession or not.
