        <h2> Introduction: </h2>
		<p>
		    For this project I will be using a deep learning model to predict recessions. 
		    I will begin with a brief overview of the problem and a review of previous 
		    literature, and follow with an overview of the data I will be using. Then 
		    I will go over how the model itself works and the results I got. Overall my 
		    model does a pretty good job at classifying whether a quarter will be a 
		    recession or not.

		    Economists have been trying to accurately predict economic downturns for as long as
			it has been a discipline. With recent developments in machine learning and neural
			networks, it is becoming increasingly more likely that this could become a reality. 
			Even before machine learning took off, economists attempted to predict recessions 
			found some success using a variable know as "term spread". Term spread is the difference 
			between interest rates on long term bonds, typically 10 or 5 year bonds, and short
			term bonds, which fall between 1 year and 3 months. Two highly cited papers, 
			Wheelock and Wohar (2009) and Mehl (2008) provide a good overview of the literature correlating
			term spread to economic output and give an example of a model using standard economic practice
			instead of machine of learning. Both papers are careful to highlight the lack of an agreed-upon
			theory that realtes the two variables, only that the relationship appears to exist. 
			<br>
			More recently, papers have been published using machine learning to predict recessions using
			the term spread. Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) introduced the economic community to the 
			possibility of machine learning being used for major problems, with close to 1000 citations 
			and providing major inspiration for this project. Vrontos, Galakis, and Vrontos (2021) looked 
			at term spread a recessions using mulitple different machine learning techniques, inlcuding logit 
			regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors to name a few. This paper 
			provided inspiration for further variables to use in addition to term spread and how to use them.
